Descrption of this project:

OVERVIEW:
This project is one of my first uni projects, when I started studying my foundation year at Kingston University (London).

The idea was, we have been given Raspberry Pi kits by the university teachers for the whole year, to support our python language learnign using connected to the computer monitor raspberry pi kit.

THE TASK:
The task was to create a Christmas card of any sorts, using only the raspberry pi and the code using python programming language.

EXECUTION:
I have thought of those lovely paper christmas cards have ither have music or the lights to try to recreate my own but virtual christmas card for this occasion.

I have used RGB colour pallete to mix and match to create as many coulourful light bobbles as possible. I used a static picture for the base of the background to have some consistency in the back view. Further the features of flashing lights have been developed to enhance the looks of the tree with real like looking lights.
